## Possibilities for craft sessions

* [Leeds Inspired list of creative workshops](https://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/creative-workshops-Leeds)
* [Leeds Inspired “crafts” tag](https://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/search?p=&wn=0&wt=3&ac=&df=&dt=&pg=&pp=2)
* [The Drawing Room at Leeds Central Library](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/leisure/libraries/music-and-art) (though events seem to be mostly on weekdays)
* [Open Source Arts](http://opensourcearts.co.uk/)
* We could host one of our own at a cafe or at the [John Lewis Community Hub](https://www.through-the-maze.org.uk/john-lewis-community-room-leeds/).  Kake would be able to provide yarn, crochet hooks, knitting needles, and crochet/knitting lessons (I’d buy the materials after arriving in Leeds and donate any leftovers to a charity shop afterwards) but someone else would have to provide paper/pencils/felt-tips/stickers/etc.  A cafe would probably be more Fun but the Community Hub is a good Plan B.
